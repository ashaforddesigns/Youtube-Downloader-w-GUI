# YouTube Downloader with GUI :video:
## Goals
To practice building GUIs and create a simple YouTube downloader. This GUI should have a button that defaults to your downloads folder and another button that let's you change where you want to save said YouTube video
## Process
1. First, I had to get familar with yt-dlp's documentation
2. I became clear in what I wanted my program to do
2. I sketched out what I wanted the interface to look like, so I could visualize better where to place the buttons
## Takeways & What I learned
- Practice makes perfect
<!--something about how TTkinter was a lot easier this time around-->
- Switching to yt-dlp 
I intended to use pytube but as of Nov 25 2024 it appears that pytube is not working. It's unfortunate because I found pytube documentation to be a lot cleaner and more acessible.
- OOP
So, I completely skipped this unit in the (Python for Everyone)[py4e.com] course. It's coming back to bite me now that I'm using a lot of libraries to write code. I'm going to go back and review this topic in more depth.
<!--Could implement a "paste from clipboard" button, or even do it automatically>
